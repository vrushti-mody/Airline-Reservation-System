PRIOR TO TRAVEL DATE
1. Check the schedule of your flight and confirm that there is no change in schedule - either call or check online
2. Print a copy of your flight tickets.
3. Keep an original identity card with you - Passport, PAN Card, Voter's ID 
4. Check the baggage rules and pack accordingly - Generally one cabin bag (bag that you can carry with you in the flight) is allowed and one or two checked-in bags (bags that you need to "check-in" (more on that later) at the airline counter and are carried in a separate baggage area in the flight)
5. Do not pack prohibited items from the following list and ensure that you put items that are not allowed in hand baggage into the checked in baggage
