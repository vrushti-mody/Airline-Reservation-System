AFTER THE FLIGHT
1. Once at your destination airport, look for airport signs and make your way to the baggage carousel - it is like a conveyor belt where you need to collect your checked-in baggage.
2. There will be multiple carousels. You will need to locate the carousel corresponding to your flight. This will sometimes be announced in the flight after your flight has landed at the destination. In any case, each carousel will also display the flight number and flight details. Ask for help, if required.
3. Get a luggage trolley, if required and wait for your checked in bags to arrive. Most times, you will be able to identify your bags by their looks. It is however advisable to double check that the luggage tag you have matches the luggage tag on your bags - many people can sometimes have the same bag and you do not want a mix up, do you?
4. Collect you bags when they arrive and exit the airport - leave the luggage trolley behind.
